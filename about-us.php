        <h1>About Us</h1>
         <h2>What is Skillsapien.com?</h2>
        <p>Skillsapien is an online skill futures exchange – we enable market bidding on current or future availability of skilled professionals worldwide. </p>
        <h2>Our Mission Statement:</h2>
        <p>Skillsapien aims to revolutionise the way professional skills are valued, by:<br/>
-	Bringing market forces of supply and demand to work for our candidates and determine their &nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHT market value<br/>
-	Help candidates optimise future time allocation based on maximised value<br/>
-	Bringing transparency to the way professional skills are priced globally.</p>
        <p>Being able to effectively allocate the future availability of a highly demanded skilled individual toward the most rewarding engagements or projects, has always been one of the greatest challenges of the skilled labour force.</p>
        <p>People traditionally have dealt with this through manually intensiveexercises such as high volume of prospecting, many time-consuming negotiations, or some times through sheer gut-instinct. Demand and supply across the freelancing and high-end self-employed profession markets are typically very opaque and often prone to regional distortions or rampant manipulation. The higher-end a skillset the more dire this situation typically becomes, even more so for those highly in high demand across multiple geographies or markets.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, most employment sites or job-bidding sites focus on more commoditised end of the skill spectrum, which tends to lead itself to differentiating purely based on (low) price. They neglect the fact that this is against human nature.</p>
        <p>Skillsapien, on the other hand, focuses on maximising the market value of the skilled individual, now and into the future. We actively encourage higher prices and rates through value and differentiated service offerings. There is a always strong demand for the “best of…” a particular skill domain in any market, it is our mission to find and help those “best of” individuals maximise their market value.</p>
        <p>The concept of bidding online for the future availability of a skilled individual is fundamentally a new concept, one that we at Skillsapien have not observed anywhere else presently on the Internet.</p>
          <h2>Our Service Offerings:</h2>
        <p>Skillsapien is not a traditional employment website or “job site”. Indeed, we are primarily not about jobs. What we are about are the talents and skills of individuals and to maximise their market value, now and into the future.</p>
        <p>A Skill provider (Candidate) can use our site to publicise their profiles and abilities online, while skill requestors can bid openly for the availability of these individuals to provision their skills.</p>
        <p>The higher in demand a skill provider’s skill is, the more likely their availability will be bided higher and higher on the open global marketplace, thereby maximising their value now and into the future!</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Skill Bidders will also be able to generate significant value through:<br/>
-	Saved time and costs in having upfront visibility on skill demands<br/>
-	Full visibility on current and future skill rates trends for a given skillset – and the ability to plan &nbsp;&nbsp;ahead accordingly<br/>
-	Before even the first interview (!), the bidder and provider will have agreedrates and start &nbsp;&nbsp;dates through the mutual acceptance of a bid.
</p>
 <h2>What’s Different About Us?</h2>
<p>Traditional “job” sites offers only job advertisements, where candidates have to trawl through hundreds or thousands of listings to find the relevant ads and apply for them. The application itself is often a tedious and long-drawn out process.</p>
<p>In more recent years, the advent of “jobbidding”websites have started to appear. These are fundamentally virtualising the outsourcing/offshoring process and trend through the mass reach of the Internet. However they are all still focused on the job, or the employer.</p>
<p>The natural tendency of these outsourcing trends is such that wherever there is a large and homogeneous supply and relatively lesser demand, for a given skillset, the skill becomes more and more commoditized.</p>
<p>On a globally open and efficient market such as the Internet, brutal market forces of demand and supply drives the provider’s rates lower and lower. The skill providers typically end up doing the bidding and in order to win they bid themselves down to get work.</p>
<p>The core fallacy with these outsourcing models is that it is against human nature to bid oneself down, especially as the skill holder gains greater knowledge and skill over time.<br/><br/>

Experience suggests that, as soon as the individual skill-holder acquires sufficiently marketable skills or experience they naturally take flight from such engagement models and stop using those “virtual outsourcing” services.
</p>

<p>So what about those skilled individuals wanting greater employment satisfaction and better rewards in the markets they WANT to work in?</p>
<p>At Skillsapien, our approach is that we focus not on the job requirementbut on the skill provider. We exist to maximise your market value, now and into the future. All of our services and offerings will be tailored around this central philosophy.</p>
